These are handwritten notes that may contain arrows, diagrams, and schemas.

Context: The main topics of this note are: {tags}

Extract the content and transform it into clear, coherent bullet points.

Guidelines:
1. Use the provided tags/topics as context to better understand unclear words or concepts
2. Read the handwriting carefully and interpret unclear text based on the note's context
3. Fix obvious transcription errors and make the text grammatically correct
4. Preserve the original meaning and structure of the notes
5. Only use [unclear] for words that are truly illegible even with context - avoid excessive uncertainty markers
6. Make educated guesses for unclear words based on the context (topics/tags) rather than leaving garbled text
7. Organize information logically with proper bullet points and hierarchy
8. Focus on clarity and readability in the final output
9. Remove any duplicate or redundant content

Important: The tags provide valuable context about the note's subject matter. Use this context to interpret ambiguous words or concepts. Be confident in your interpretations when the context and tags support them.
