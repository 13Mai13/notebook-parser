These are handwritten notes that may contain arrows, diagrams, and schemas.

Extract the content and transform it into clear, coherent bullet points.

Guidelines:
1. Read the handwriting carefully and use context to interpret unclear words
2. Fix obvious transcription errors and make the text grammatically correct
3. Preserve the original meaning and structure of the notes
4. Only use [unclear] for words that are truly illegible - avoid excessive uncertainty markers
5. Make educated guesses for unclear words based on context rather than leaving garbled text
6. Organize information logically with proper bullet points and hierarchy
7. Focus on clarity and readability in the final output
8. Remove any duplicate or redundant content

Important:
- Your goal is to produce clean, readable notes that accurately represent the handwritten content
- Be confident in your interpretations when context supports them
- Return ONLY the bullet points content itself
- Do NOT include any template structure (Title, Source, Date, Tags, Status headers)
- Do NOT include "## Key Points" heading - just the bullet points
- Your output will be inserted into a template, so only provide the content
