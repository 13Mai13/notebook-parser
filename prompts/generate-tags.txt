Analyze this handwritten note and identify the main topics and themes.

Extract 3-7 tags that represent the key subjects, concepts, or areas covered in the note.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on the main topics, not minor details
2. Use clear, concise tags (1-3 words each, lowercase with hyphens)
3. Tags should help provide context for understanding the note's domain and subject matter
4. Each tag must start with # (for Obsidian compatibility)

Return ONLY the tags separated by spaces (e.g., "#machine-learning #neural-networks #backpropagation")
